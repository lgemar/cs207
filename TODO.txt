basics: Erik thursday
<X> constructors
<X> add triangle
<X> private data
<X> triangle class

iterators: Lukas friday
<x> triangle iterator
<x> begin end functions for triangle iterator
<x> adjacent iterator
<x> begin end functions for adjacent iterator
<x> build display to show triangle centers and links
< > tell erik about andy's 21st birthday

functionality:
<X> find triangle
<X> num triangles
<X> num connections

math:
<X> normal
<X> area

shallow water:
< > Clean up code, hyperbolic_step still has some jank conditional statements
< > Calculate the dt time step. Right now the "max_height" is hard-coded, so 
	the time step calculation could be refined by updating this value to be the
	correct value.

Mesh: 
< > Comment preconditions, postconditions, and invariants
< > Specifically, make sure that "normal" functions are well commented

Graph:
< > There is an invariant in the construction of edges that is not enforced. 
	This becomes evident when getting the value of the edge -- it depends
	on the order in which the uids are passed into the constructor...it is 
	marked in the code with a TODO
