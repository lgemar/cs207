shallow water:
< > Clean up code, hyperbolic_step still has some jank conditional statements
< > Calculate the dt time step. Right now the "max_height" is hard-coded, so 
	the time step calculation could be refined by updating this value to be the
	correct value.

Mesh: 
< > Comment preconditions, postconditions, and invariant
< > Specifically, make sure that "normal" functions are well commented
