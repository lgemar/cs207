In addition to the information from our design document for hw 4A, 
we added the ability to select initial conditions for the graph
via command line argument.

As a 3rd argument, the user can optionally input the text:
'dam', 'pebble', 'wave', and the mesh will be initialized
for those situations. If no argument is specified, or if
the argument is not recognized, it is defaulted to wave.
